# Brand Voice Guidelines

## Overview

Our brand voice is the personality that comes through in every piece of communication—from marketing copy to in-app messaging to customer support. We're talking to Gen Z students (class of 2025-2029) and their parents simultaneously. That's a tightrope: too corporate and students tune out; too try-hard and everyone cringes.

The sweet spot? **Confident, clear, and real.** We know our stuff, we say it straight, and we don't waste anyone's time.

---

## Voice Positioning

**We are:** The advisor who actually gets it. Smart, a little irreverent, zero fluff. We cut through the college admissions chaos with real talk and real tools.

**We are not:** 
- A stuffy institution that talks at you
- A fear-mongering service that profits off anxiety
- A "how do you do, fellow kids" brand forcing slang
- Another generic platform with generic advice

---

## Understanding Our Audience

### Gen Z Students (Born ~2007-2012)
- **They're digital natives.** They've been navigating information overload their whole lives. They can spot low-effort content instantly.
- **They're anxious but don't want to be coddled.** They know the stakes. Don't lecture them about it.
- **They value authenticity over polish.** Perfect = suspicious. Real = trustworthy.
- **They're skeptical of institutions.** They've watched older siblings and friends get burned by generic advice.
- **They want agency.** This is *their* process. Don't talk over them.
- **They respond to confidence.** Wishy-washy doesn't cut it. Say what you mean.
- **They appreciate wit.** Not everything needs to be deadly serious.

### Parents (Mostly Millennials & Gen X)
- Deeply invested but often unsure how to help
- Want clear, actionable guidance without the condescension
- Worried about both outcomes AND the mental health of their kids
- Willing to pay for something that actually works

**The key insight:** Both audiences want the same thing—straight talk, real tools, and someone who actually knows what they're doing. We don't need to code-switch dramatically. We just need to be genuinely good.

## Core Voice Attributes

### 1. Confident, Not Cocky
We know what we're talking about. We say it clearly. We don't hedge with "maybe" and "perhaps" when we have real data. But we're not here to flex—we're here to help.

| ✓ Do This | ✗ Not This |
|---|---|
| "Here's the move." | "We humbly suggest you might consider..." |
| "This works. Here's why." | "Trust us, we're the best!" |
| "Students in your position typically see..." | "We guarantee results!" |
| "Real talk: your essay needs work." | "Perhaps you might want to revisit..." |

---

### 2. Direct & No-BS
Time is precious. Attention is scarce. Get to the point. If something matters, say it. If something's fluff, cut it.

| ✓ Do This | ✗ Not This |
|---|---|
| "Deadline in 5 days. Here's what's left." | "We wanted to gently remind you that..." |
| "This program is competitive. Worth it." | "This prestigious opportunity offers..." |
| "Your GPA is solid. Here's what to focus on instead." | "While your academic performance is commendable..." |
| "Skip this. It won't move the needle." | "You might consider whether this is the optimal use of your time." |

---

### 3. Real, Not Performative
We don't try to sound like a teenager. We don't force slang. We just talk like actual humans who respect the person we're talking to.

| ✓ Do This | ✗ Not This |
|---|---|
| "That's a strong profile." | "Slay! Your profile is giving main character energy!" |
| "This one's worth your time." | "This opportunity is fire 🔥" |
| "Rough news. Let's figure out what's next." | "We're so sorry for this difficult situation." |
| "Nice." | "Absolutely phenomenal achievement!" |

**The rule:** Write how a smart 28-year-old would text a smart 17-year-old they respect.

---

### 4. Empowering Without the Pep Rally
We build confidence by giving people real tools and real information—not empty encouragement. We trust students to handle the truth.

| ✓ Do This | ✗ Not This |
|---|---|
| "Your chances at MIT are real but not guaranteed. Here's what tips the odds." | "You can do anything you set your mind to!" |
| "This is a stretch school. Apply anyway—here's why." | "Dream big! Reach for the stars!" |
| "You're behind on this. Fixable if you start now." | "Don't worry, everything will work out!" |
| "Stanford said no. It happens. Your other apps are still live." | "This rejection doesn't define you! 💪" |

---

### 5. Warm But Not Soft
We care about outcomes. We're not here to be your therapist, but we're also not robots. We can acknowledge the human reality of this process without getting sappy.

| ✓ Do This | ✗ Not This |
|---|---|
| "That rejection stings. Take a beat, then let's look at options." | "We understand this must be so devastating for you." |
| "This process is a lot. That's normal." | "We're SO here for you through every emotion!" |
| "Good work. That took effort." | "WOW! We are SO proud of you!!! 🎉" |
| "Questions? We're around." | "Please don't hesitate to reach out!" |

---

### 6. Family-Inclusive (Without Taking Sides)
Students drive this. Parents support it. We help both work together without the weird power dynamics.

| ✓ Do This | ✗ Not This |
|---|---|
| "Students: here's your move. Parents: here's how to help without hovering." | "Parents, make sure your child does this." |
| "Share this with your family—or don't. Your call." | "Make sure to involve your parents!" |
| "Parents: you've got good instincts. Here's the context you're missing." | "Parents, you don't understand how college works now." |

## Tone Spectrum

Same voice, different intensity depending on context:

```
Lighter ←————————————————————————————————————→ Heavier

[Wins/Updates]    [General Guidance]    [Deadlines]    [Setbacks/Hard Truths]

Casual,           Clear, helpful,       Direct,        Honest, grounded,
maybe funny       confident             urgent         solution-focused
```

### Tone by Scenario

**Win/Good News:**
> "Your SAT scores just dropped. 1520. That's not just good—that opens doors at every school on your list. Profile updated."

**General Guidance:**
> "Summer before senior year is prime time for research experience. Here are 4 programs that match your profile, ranked by fit."

**Deadline/Urgency:**
> "UC apps close in 72 hours. Essays: done. LORs: done. Activities section: needs 10 minutes. Finish this."

**Hard Truth:**
> "Your reach schools are real reaches—sub-10% admit rates, your profile's competitive but not a lock. Apply, but make sure your targets and safeties are schools you'd actually want to attend."

**Rejection:**
> "MIT said no. That's a tough one. But here's the reality: your RD apps are still out, and your profile hasn't changed. The schools that said yes to your application are about to make decisions. Stay focused."

## Writing Principles

### 1. Respect Their Intelligence
Gen Z has been researching, comparing, and analyzing since they could hold a phone. Don't explain things they already know. Don't dumb it down.

### 2. Front-Load the Value
Say the important thing first. They'll scroll past buildup.

❌ "As you continue on your college journey, you may find it helpful to consider..."  
✅ "Here's a program that fits: Stanford SIMR. Deadline March 1."

### 3. Short > Long (Usually)
Brevity signals confidence. If you can say it in 5 words, don't use 15.

❌ "We wanted to take a moment to let you know that..."  
✅ "Quick update:"

### 4. Make It Actionable
Every piece of communication should make it clear: *what now?*

❌ "Consider exploring opportunities in your area of interest."  
✅ "Three summer programs match your profile. Applications take 20 min. Start here."

### 5. Specificity > Generality
Personalization is our whole thing. Generic advice is lazy.

❌ "Build leadership experience."  
✅ "You've got coding skills and 120 volunteer hours. Run for president of the CS club."

### 6. Skip the Qualifiers
"Perhaps," "maybe," "a little bit," "in some ways"—these weaken everything. Say what you mean.

## Voice Check

Before publishing anything, ask:

1. **Would a smart 17-year-old actually read this?** If it sounds like a brochure, rewrite.
2. **Are we saying something or just making noise?** Cut the filler.
3. **Is this actionable?** What's the next step?
4. **Does this respect their intelligence?** No explaining the obvious.
5. **Is this specific?** Generic = forgettable.
6. **Would we be embarrassed if this went viral?** No cringe allowed.

---

## The One-Line Test

If someone asked "what's this brand like?" the answer should be:

> "Smart, straight-up, and actually useful. Like having a friend who knows how college admissions actually works."

Not:

> "Friendly, supportive, and here to guide you on your journey!"

---

*This is a living document. The voice should evolve as we learn what resonates—but "authentic, confident, and useful" stays constant.*
