# Sesame3 Pricing Strategy

## Model: Freemium

A generous free tier that delivers real value, with Premium for serious applicants and families.

---

## Free Tier (Forever Free)

| Feature | What You Get | Limit |
|---------|--------------|-------|
| **AI Advisor Chat** | General questions, guidance, brainstorming | **20 messages/week** (resets weekly) |
| **Profile Building** | Academics, activities, awards, story | Unlimited |
| **School Discovery** | Browse & explore schools | Unlimited |
| **School List** | Save schools to your list | **Up to 3 schools** |
| **Chances** | Reach / Target / Safety labels | Basic tier only (no detailed %) |
| **Roadmap** | Tasks & deadlines | Basic (manual entry) |
| **Chat Mode** | Text only | — |
| **Access** | Student only | No sharing |

### Why These Limits
- **20 messages/week** = ~3/day average — enough to be useful, creates natural upgrade pressure
- **3 schools** = enough to try the feature, but serious applicants need 10-15+
- **Basic chances** = useful directional guidance, but detailed breakdowns require Premium
- **No sharing** = solo experience; family/counselor visibility is Premium

## Upgrade Moments

When free users naturally hit a wall and consider Premium:

1. **"I ran out of messages"** — mid-research burst, want to keep chatting
2. **"I want to add more schools"** — hit the 3-school limit
3. **"What are my actual chances?"** — want detailed % breakdown
4. **"Can you review my essay?"** — Premium-only feature
5. **"I want to talk, not type"** — voice chat is Premium
6. **"My parents want to see my progress"** — shared access is Premium

---

## Cost Control

- Free tier message cap (20/week) controls AI API costs
- Essay review is Premium-only (expensive per-request)
- Voice chat is Premium-only (higher cost than text)
- No unlimited free users draining resources

---

## Competitive Positioning

| Alternative | Cost | Sesame3 Advantage |
|-------------|------|-------------------|
| Private counselor | $2,000–$10,000+ | 50-100x cheaper |
| School counselor | Free but 15 min/year | 24/7 availability, personalized |
| Other apps (CollegeVine, etc.) | Free-ish | Conversational AI, not forms |

---

## Target Segments

| Segment | Likely Plan |
|---------|-------------|
| 9th–10th graders exploring | Free |
| 11th graders getting serious | Premium Annual |
| 12th graders in crunch mode | Senior Year Pass |
| Anxious parents wanting visibility | Premium (for shared access) |

## Future Considerations

- **Family Plan**: One subscription covers parent + multiple children
- **School/District Licensing**: B2B for schools
- **Counselor Pro**: For independent counselors to use with clients
