# College Counseling Platform - Concept Overview

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive college preparation platform that consolidates all college-related information and opportunities in one place, while providing personalized AI-powered advisory services to help students and parents navigate the college preparation journey strategically.

- **Opportunity Discovery Gap**: Students miss local competitions, research programs, and volunteer opportunities due to poor visibility
- **Family Coordination**: Parents and students often work with different information sources and timelines
- **Reactive Planning**: Most tools help with college applications but not the 2-4 year preparation journey
